@par Demo Description 
 
Demonstration of firmware based on STM32Cube. This example uses the MEMS motion
sensor to blink the four LEDs according to the motion direction,the linear
touch sensor blink the four LEDs according to the finger position.
Below you find the sequence to launch the discover demonstration :

  - Four LEDs blink
       
  - The gyroscope MEMS sensor (L3GD20 or I3G4250D):  move the board and observe LEDs blinking
    according to motion direction.
    Right : LED5 is ON.
    Left  : LED4 is ON.
    UP    : LED3 is ON.
    DOWN  : LED6 is ON.
     
  - Touch Sensor Linear (TSL) blink the four LEDs according to the finger position
    it can perform in both direction.
                              
                
Note: - Press user button to swich from sequence to the second one.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This Demonstration has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F072B-DISCO board
    can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.      
  - This Demonstration runs on STM32F072RB devices.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Open your preferred toolchain 
- Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
